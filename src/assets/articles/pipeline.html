        <p>Pipeline is a 2D fluid simulation puzzle game with 107 levels and around 6+ hours of content. The core gameplay loop sees the player finding ways to solve each level’s obstacles and getting fluids into an end goal pipe. The are multiple different types of fluids, each with unique behaviors and interactions with world objects. Players explore, learn, and utilize the properties of game elements to overcome each level.</p>
        <p>This is the fourth Pipeline game that I have made, but because it was the first released publicly, I reset the logo’s numbering for this title.</p>
