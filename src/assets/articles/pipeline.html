        Pipeline was developed iteratively over six months during my high school years, working through my schoolâ€™s sneakernet. I programmed and designed each of the 107 levels and gameplay systems, with rigorous testing and feedback from players. The game revolves around guiding different types of fluids by painting tiles, with each fluid exhibiting unique behaviors and interactions with the environment.
        <br>
        I focused on making the gameplay both complex and engaging by ensuring that the interactions between fluids, pipes, and obstacles created intricate puzzles. At the same time, I prioritized accessibility by incorporating features like visual effect toggles, allowing players to disable elements such as screen flipping, which could be uncomfortable for some users. This approach ensured the game was both challenging for puzzle enthusiasts and accessible to a wider audience.
