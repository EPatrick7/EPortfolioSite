            Astronomous is a dynamic 2D shooter where you pilot a lone ship through relentless swarms of enemies. Every pixel of your ship, and those of your enemies, is destructible. Damaged pixels will regenerate over time, unless too many are lost, in which case the entire ship collapses. 
            <br>
            Key systems, such as weapons, shields, and warp drives, are tied to specific parts of your ship. If your main cannon is destroyed, you’ll lose the ability to fire; if your warp drive is hit, your escape options disappear temporarily. As you progress, you’ll unlock new ships, each with unique weapons and abilities, allowing for different playstyles.
