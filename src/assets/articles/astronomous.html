           Astronomous is a top-down shooter game where you control one ship fighting its way through hordes of enemy ships. Each pixel of both you and your enemies ships can be destroyed, but will eventually regenerate, when hit. After enough pixels are destroyed, the ship will fully fall apart and be destroyed, so your hull integrity is the physical representation of your HP. Additionally, ship functionalities are tied to specific pixels in your ship, and can be disabled if destroyed. For example, if your main cannon is shot off you can no longer fire weapons, or if your warp drive is damaged you loose the ability to escape out of tricky situations temporarily.  As you play, you will unlock additional ships, each with its own weapons and abilities. To have the best experience it is recommended to use the downloadable installer version of the game.
