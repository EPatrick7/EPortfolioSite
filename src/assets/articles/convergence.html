          Convergence is a real-time gravity simulation game with thousands of particles. When two particles collide, the larger consumes the smaller, gaining its mass. Planets also possess elements that players can utilize for special abilities, such as Ice Shielding and Gas Propelling. The game supports console controllers and offers both single-player and local multiplayer modes for up to four players. In the spring of 2024, I pitched and led a team of four peers to develop this game over 10 weeks through UCI's Video Game Development Club as a Pitch-Project.
