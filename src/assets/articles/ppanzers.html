            Pocket Panzers is an online multiplayer artillery game where players control tanks on a procedurally generated 2D mountain. Using strategic movement and precise aiming, players fire shells at opponents that destroy the terrain in addition to dealing damage. Each round, players earn funding to purchase new ammunition, with the last tank standing declared the winner. The game runs entirely in-browser, requiring no downloads, just two or more players ready for battle.

        Pocket Panzers was my first experience creating an online multiplayer game, providing invaluable insights into building safe, functional multiplayer code while maintaining smooth gameplay. The game revolves around tanks battling on a procedurally generated 2D mountain, created using Perlin Noise.

        I focused on ensuring the game was easy to play by building it to run entirely in-browser, with no downloads required. This approach allowed players to quickly jump into matches without friction. My primary goal was to make the experience as enjoyable as possible for friends, ensuring smooth and engaging gameplay.
