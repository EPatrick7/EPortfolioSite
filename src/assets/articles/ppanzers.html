                Pocket Panzers is an online multiplayer artillery game. Playing as opposing tanks spread randomly on a procedurally generated 2D mountain, players must maneuver themselves and their launch trajectories to hit enemies reliably. Players receive an increasing amount of funding each round, and can spend it on shells to launch at their opponents, and the last tank standing is the winner. The game is run on WebGL and requires no download to play, just two or more people.
