            Professor Maren & The Aqueous Stones was my solo submission to the University of Delaware's Climate Change Game Jam. This game features a Compute Shader fluid simulation that models ocean waves on a globe. Players take on the role of an Ocean Spirit, protecting Professor Maren as she seeks to assemble the Aqueous Stones, a supposed "Silver Bullet" against climate change. Each level challenges players to strategically manage a limited pool of energy, summoning waves, waterspouts, whirlpools, and hurricanes to overcome obstacles and defend the Professor.

        Professor Maren & The Aqueous Stones was created as my solo submission to the University of Delaware’s Climate Change Game Jam. The game features a Compute Shader fluid simulation that models ocean waves on a Mercator projection Earth, mapped onto a globe. This marked my first experience with compute shaders, which provided invaluable insights I later applied to Convergence. The game was built using Unity and completed within the two-week jam period.

        Professor Maren & The Aqueous Stones won "Best Overall Game" in the University of Delaware’s Climate Change Game Jam. It received praise for its innovative gameplay, unique art style, and immersive sound design. Judges appreciated the game’s narrative, with the final twist that there is no “Silver Bullet” for climate change, only actions we can take in the present.
