            Professor Maren & The Aqueous Stones was my solo submission to the University of Delaware's Climate Change Game Jam. This game features a Compute Shader fluid simulation that models ocean waves on a globe. Players take on the role of an Ocean Spirit, protecting Professor Maren as she seeks to assemble the Aqueous Stones, a supposed "Silver Bullet" against climate change. Each level challenges players to strategically manage a limited pool of energy, summoning waves, waterspouts, whirlpools, and hurricanes to overcome obstacles and defend the Professor.
