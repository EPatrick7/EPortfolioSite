        <p class="bold">Welcome</p>
        <p class="normal">

            I am a game designer and programmer with experience in Unity and Node.js, specializing in creating engaging and innovative gameplay experiences. From early personal projects to advanced multiplayer games, I have always focused on pushing creative and technical boundaries.
            <br>
            Currently, I am pursuing a double major in Game Design and Computer Science at UCI, where I collaborate with peers to develop games that challenge us to grow as designers and developers. This portfolio showcases some of my best work. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
