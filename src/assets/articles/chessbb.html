            Chess But Better is an online chess mod created for a group class project. The assignment challenged teams to modify or build upon core chess mechanics to serve a specific purpose. Our team focused on leveling the playing field between novice and expert players by introducing an element of randomness.
        <br>
            To achieve this, we incorporated randomly spawning items that activate unique effects when a piece moves onto them. These effects range from freezing nearby pieces to temporarily transforming a piece into the “Monster,” a hybrid of a queen and a knight. By disrupting rigid strategies, these mechanics force both newcomers and seasoned players to adapt dynamically, making for a more unpredictable and engaging chess experience.
