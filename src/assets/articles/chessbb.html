           Chess But Better is an online chess mod game made for a group class project. In the assignment, teams had to modify or build on core elements of chess to achieve a specific purpose. Our group aimed to increase the chance that a novice could edge out a victory against an expert player by introducing randomness into the chess experience. To accomplish this we added randomly spawning items. When the player moves a chess piece onto a tile with an item, a random power will be immediately invoked. Ranging from freezing all pieces nearby to temporarily transmuting a piece into the "Monster" piece (a queen-knight hybrid piece), the items added to the game can punch holes into rigid strategies and force novice and experts alike to play differently.
