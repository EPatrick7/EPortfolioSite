            For the last 5 years, I have been creating expansive datapack survival pseudo-mods that add a large amount of new content into the game, each more elaborate than the last.
            I have utilized the rapid-prototyping abilities inherient to minecraft development -everything is happening live in the game as you develop it- to create expansive custom experiences for my players to enjoy.
            PCE has about 40 hours of additional content added to the base game. The most valuable experience that I have gained from hosting these servers, aside from the amazing amount of fun we all have, is experience in live-updating a game.
            Since PCE has such an expansive library of additional content, and since it is coded in the in-game command coding language, bugs are inevitable. Because everything is happening quickly and on a server, rapid fixes to bugs are a priority, and downtime must be avoided at all costs.
            In addition to the occasional bug-fix, live monitoring of the in-game economy has been one of my duties, and I frequently tweak balance decisions to optimize player experiences.
