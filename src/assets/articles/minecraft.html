        For the past seven years, I have been developing expansive survival experiences in Minecraft using only in-game commands. PCE∅ is the ninth and final entry in this series, and my most ambitious project yet. In this adventure, players explore nine diverse dimensions, each hiding three Null Shards. Beyond the base game, PCE∅ introduces a deep Technology Tree and Runic Magic system, offering players a satisfying blend of exploration, strategy, and progression.

            Coded entirely over six months within the Esolang that is Minecraft’s commands and datapack system, I pushed the absolute limits of the base game. Notable features include full RTS-style mini-game dimensions, a complete Pokémon knockoff dimension, and custom fragment and vertex shaders that create immersive world curvature in custom dimension levels.

            Building on previous versions, I refined the gameplay loop of resource extraction, crafting, and progression through Runic Magic and Technology Trees. This design created a satisfying blend of exploration, strategy, and progression. Each of the nine dimensions hides three Null Shards, with deep systems and strategic elements that ensure players remain engaged and invested for hundreds of hours.

            PCE∅ initially had a troubled launch due to the departure of the legacy player base. However, it ultimately became the most successful version of the series. Word of mouth helped spread the gameplay to new communities of players. The game remains in active development, with regular updates, bug fixes, and live service support to balance gameplay. I personally manage the server community to ensure they’re having the best possible experience.
