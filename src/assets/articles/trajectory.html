            Trajectory is a space-themed mini-golf game where gravity is applied to your ball as it moves. Each planet, asteroid, and hazard exerts a gravitational pull that influences the ball’s trajectory. Your goal is to sink the ball in as few shots as possible. Levels have a set par, and your final rank depends on your shot count and retries. While reaching the goal is easy, mastering the game and earning high ranks such as the optimal “X” rank, completing the level in a single shot, is not.

        Design & Development
    </div>

    <div class="text"><p>
        Trajectory was developed in high school and became my most successful game according to Itch.io analytics. My primary focus was on creating snappy, rewarding gameplay with short, challenging levels that encourage mastery. While completing levels is straightforward, achieving higher ranks adds an extra layer of challenge for more experienced players.
        <br>
        Throughout development, I ensured that the underlying tools were accessible to users. As the founder of my high school’s game development club, I used Trajectory as an opportunity to teach members about Unity and level design by allowing them to create their own custom level mods. This hands-on approach not only let others experience the development process but also contributed to a more scalable development environment for myself.
