            Trajectory is a space mini-golf game where the ball is affected by gravity. Each of the planets, asteroids and hazards in a level exert a gravitational force. The objective is to have the ball reach the goal in the least amount of shots. Each level has a “par” value and based on how close to it, plus the amount of redo shots you have taken, determine the rank that you receive at the end of the level. All levels can be completed in one shot for “X” rank. The game itself is not difficult if you do not care about what rank you receive, but the challenge lies in getting the highest rank possible. To have the best experience it is recommended to use the itch.io version of the game.
