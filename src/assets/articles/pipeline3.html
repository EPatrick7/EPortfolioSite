            Pipeline 3 is the previous installment in my Pipeline series, and is one of my oldest games. By taking feedback on players of Pipeline 1-2, and this game especially, I was able to improve Pipeline 4 (Pipeline) significantly.

            Like its sequel, Pipeline is a puzzle game about moving fluids into the goal pipe. You select from an ever growing palette of tiles to interact with the simulation and get the fluids or objects where you want them to be. By pressing alt while placing or by double clicking on an existing tile, you can switch it to its alternative form (IE: normal tiles become acid vulnerable in their alternate form). Each tile and fluid is subject to a temperature simulation and will exchange temperatures on contact. If fluids reach certain temperatures, they can freeze or vaporize.
